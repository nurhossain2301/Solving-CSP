# Solving-CSP
These programs solve constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) using bactracking search and AC3 algorithm. Only least constraining value is used as heuristics. Other heuristics also can be imeplemented.
Sudoku and map coloring problem are solved in these two codes. These algorithms can also be implemented to solve other CSPs.
Code has been checked in python version 3.6 and above. To solve sudoku it takes less than 60s.
